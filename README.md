# Introduction

A database is a collection of [information](https://searchsqlserver.techtarget.com/definition/information) that is organised so that it can be easily accessed, managed and  updated. Computer databases typically contain aggregations of data  records or [files](https://searchsqlserver.techtarget.com/definition/flat-file), containing information about sales transactions or interactions with specific customers.

### Background

The [database management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database#Database_management_system) (DBMS) is the [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software) that interacts with [end users](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_user), applications, and the database itself to capture and analyse the data.  The DBMS software additionally encompasses the core facilities provided  to administer the database. The sum total of the database, the DBMS and  the associated applications can be referred to as a "database system".  Often the term "database" is also used to loosely refer to any of the  DBMS, the database system or an application associated with the  database.
