# Introduction

### MongoDB

> MongoDB is a open-source document database and leading NoSQL database with the scalability and flexibility that you want with the querying and indexing.

### MongoDB Atlas

> MongoDB Atlas provides an easy way to host and manage your data in the cloud. MongoDB Atlas is a fully-managed cloud database.

# Prerequisites

No background knowledge is required for this tutorial, just simply follow the activities given below.

---

# Activities

### Activity 1: Create or login into MongoDB Atlas account

-   Either Register on: https://account.mongodb.com/account/register

    <img src="images/register.png">

    **(OR)**

    Login at: https://account.mongodb.com/account/login

    <img src="images/login.png"/>

-   You will land on the following dashboard page:

    <img src="images/dashboard.png"/>

### Activity 2: Create a new cluster for your database

-   Click on Create Cluster on dashboard page and choose the type of cluster plan

    <img src="images/dashboard.png"/>

-   Choose on Cloud Provider & Cloud region

    <img src="images/createCluster1.png"/>

-   Choose your cluster settings & name your cluster

    <img src="images/createCluster2.png"/>

-   Now, click "Create Cluster" and it will take a few minutes to setup your cluster on cloud

    <img src="images/createCluster3.png"/>

### Activity 3: Add Connection and your IP address to the list to access the cluster

-   Click on "Connnect" for conncection setup

      <img src="images/setup0.jpg"/>

-   Here, this tutorial uses connect using by using MongoDB's native drivers (Option2)

      <img src="images/setup1.jpg"/>

-   Here, choose the driver of your choice e.g. Python, Nodejs and choose the version of lanugage you are using.

      <img src="images/setup2.jpg"/>

-   For adding the IP address click on "Network Access" and all your IP address over there(This is done for secure access to cluster).

-   If you want the cluster to be accessible from everywhere, then just ensure whether there exists an entry of 0.0.0.0 in the list.

-   Now, create a python file and insert the following snippet

**Note: Copy the driver code example of your created cluster, as the connection url is different for each cluster**

```python
import pymongo

connection_url = "mongodb+srv://Girish:<password>@criobytes.dyseu.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

# This url will be different for everyone.
# Update the <password> with your user's password (You will have to create one new user if not available).
# Replace <dbname> with the name of database of your choice.

client = pymongo.MongoClient(connection_url)
db = client.test
```

### Activity 4: Install the native driver library to connect to your MongoDB Cluster

-   This tutorial uses Python language for demonstration.
-   Firstly open terminal and copy the following snippet & paste it in the terminal.

```bash
    $ pip install pymongo
```

### Activity 5: Run the python file & watch the results

-   Python code snippet for accessing & performing read/writes on the database in your cluster

```python

import pymongo
# pip install dnspython (This library is needed to make network calls to the cluster)
import dns

db_name = "CrioBytes"
connection_url = "mongodb+srv://CrioBytes:CrioBytes@criobytes.dyseu.mongodb.net/"+db_name+"?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
collection_name = "users"
# This url will be different for everyone.
# Update the password your user's password (You will have to create one new user if not available).
conn = pymongo.MongoClient(connection_url)
db = conn[db_name]
col = db[collection_name]

# data to be inserted in database db & in collection col
user = {"name": "Jackie", "gender": "Male" }

# insert_one is used to insert single document
ins_doc = col.insert_one(user)

# print the document id of the newly inserted document
print("The id of newly inserted document is: ", ins_doc.inserted_id)

new_user = {"name": "Julia" , "gender": "Female"}
ins_doc = col.insert_one(new_user)
# print the document id of the newly inserted document
print("The id of newly inserted document is: ", ins_doc.inserted_id)

for c in col.find():
    print(c)
```

-   The output of above code:

    <img src="./images/output1.png">

-   Now, go to the cluster on atlas and click collections, one will find the newly inserted data being updated there.

Hooray ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ We have successfully setup clusters, created database and acccessed it through our personal laptop/desktop.

# Summary

We have created a database on MongoDB Atlas and accessed it from your own laptop.
